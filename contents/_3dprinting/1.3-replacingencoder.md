The encoder of my Zonestar Z8P 3D printer was damaged after a short time. Fortunately, the printer came with a replacement. However, I tried to repair the original control to have a functional spare in case something goes wrong.

I got the encoder replacement from [Aliexpress](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mqSKwxK){:target="_blank"}. Follow these steps to repair the PCB:

1. Clean the excess solder from the pins of the encoder.
2. Cut the old encoder pins.
3. Remove the remaining pins with desoldering braid or a similar tool. In the video, I improvised a tool using an old resistor I had in my toolkit.
4. Place the new encoder and solder it.
5. Install the board in the printer and test the results before final assembly.
