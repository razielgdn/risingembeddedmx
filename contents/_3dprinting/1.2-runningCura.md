# Introduction
When I checked the documentation from Zonestar for slicing objects to print, I noticed that **Prusa Slicer** and **Ultimaker Cura 5.7.1** are available for use with Ubuntu. However, when trying to add the printer definitions, I encountered an issue where I couldn't slice. This issue persisted even when testing with other printers until I deleted the definition folder. In this article, I will demonstrate how to solve this issue.

# Download and installation
The official version of Ultimaker Cura 5.7.1 can be downloaded from [Offical page](https://ultimaker.com/es/software/ultimaker-cura/#downloads){:target="_blank"}.
- Download the **Linux.AppImage** file. 
- Allow execution permission for the file.
    - Graphically:
       1. Right click in **UltiMaker-Cura-5.7.1-linux-X64.AppImage** 
       2. In the Permissions tab, check the Execute option.
    - In the terminal execute `chmod 755 UltiMaker-Cura-5.7.1-linux-X64.AppImage`
- Double-click the file and wait for the program to run.

# Add  definitions for Zonestar printers
 I found that Ultimaker Cura is available for use with Zonestar printers after copying the configuration files to the installation directory. A tutorial on how to do this from Zonestar is located on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2GynyUo7wQ){:target="_blank"}.    
 1. Download **Zonestar_Cura_resources.zip** for cura from  [Zonestar Slicing-Guide](https://github.com/ZONESTAR3D/Slicing-Guide/tree/master/cura){:target="_blank"}.   
 2. Decompress the files.   
 3. Copy the folders "materials", "extruders", and "definitions" on the installation path. On Ubuntu 22.04, the installation files are located at:   
    `~/.local/share/cura/5.7`     
 4. Go to [razielgdn/Zonestar3DNotesAndTriks](https://github.com/razielgdn/Zonestar3DNotesAndTricks/tree/main/Resources/definitions){:target="_blank"} and download the files.  
 5. **Copy and replace** the files *fdmextruder.def.json* and *fdmprinter.def.json* in **definitions** folder.  
 The software is ready to be used with Zonestars printers.

# Explanation
Cura is configured with JSON files. The Zonestar file was developed for an old version of Cura. When I checked the logfile, I noticed that **prime_tower_mode** was not defined. After searching Google for a solution, I didn't find much. However, I found a solution in the [Ultimaker/Cura repository](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura){:target="_blank"}, where the definition files are located in *resources/definitions*. The solution was to merge the missing definitions.
