Today I finally **finished writing** my latest article for this site. In the projects section, you can find a guide for **taking** a [technical interview](https://razielgdn.github.io/risingembeddedmx/projects/en/embedded-topics/embedded-questions-en){:target="_blank"} - **covering** the common questions that engineers ask and the possible responses that I use.

**There are many questions that I've collected over the years** from conducting interviews since 2018, when I started **looking for** a good job as a developer. Before I **got into** embedded software, I was **a humble** network technician, electromechanical technician, and photovoltaic panel installer - **the reality that many** southern Mexican **electronics** engineers **face**.

As you **can read** in this blog, I **don't have a job right now**. But I have a couple of interviews **coming up**, and I'm starting to **brush up on** my "single-use" knowledge. **While writing** these posts, I'm also working on another **article about** the common challenges I **encountered on my journey** - mathematical and algorithmic problems **that we'll never see in real-world work**. For example, solving [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/){:target="_blank"} challenges based on mathematical functions or complex algorithms with **a 30-minute deadline**.

In real life, the challenges are **managing timelines** with project managers, solving **usability issues** (because **system users don't read manuals**), **and dealing with** poor communication between hardware, software, and systems teams.

**Only time has given me these experiences**, and I now know what my challenges and **obstacles will be**. **Maybe this experience will be** useful for someone, and I'm **at peace with that**.

Good **luck** to me and to you (if we're **at** the same crossroad).
