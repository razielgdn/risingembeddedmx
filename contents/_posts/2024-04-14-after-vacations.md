## After vacations
After a busy work season, a break is necessary.
"Last week of February, I wanted to take a couple of days off, and I managed to get it for an indefinite period." - Abner, my brother.
We worked as embedded software developers in the same company for a while, and unfortunately, the layoffs in high technology companies affected us.

I was exhausted from programming because last month at work, I had to work more than 10 hours a day just to learn how to do my tasks. However, I was laid off from my job. After these canon events I decide do some Udemy curses, pick up ciclysm again to  prepare myself phisically and mentally for a new season. 

I took a Scrum course focused on Jira to improve these skills.
During the last week of March and the first week of April, I took a break to disconnect from computers and work.
Yesterday, I finished a course to enhance my knowledge of the Yocto Project.
