This site use Jekyll to be created at the begining I used a native installation in fedora 38 or 39 I dont remmember  but my pc failed by an electrical failure and I lost the ssd. After replace the hardware and start to be more active with my content I decided to use Ubuntu because Its more used by the mortals.  

Somebody said that I am a kind of masoquist and traidor to the free software because I use fedora since 2008 whan I star in my journey as developer (In a future post I will count the history maybe) 
Well Whether I like it or not, ubuntu is more used (As i know) to develop embedded systems behind linux.  And how I want to help other developers more specific my Universidad tecnologica de la mixteca Colleague (i prefeer say comrades but I know more conservative engineers in the field and... on second though my readers use gnu linux)
