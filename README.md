# Rising Embedded MX

Welcome to my embedded systems engineering blog! This is where I document my journey through the world of microcontrollers, bootloaders, and embedded software development.

## About

**Rising Embedded MX** is my personal technical blog where I share:

- **Project Development Logs**: Real-time documentation of embedded projects, including challenges, solutions, and lessons learned
- **Technical Implementations**: Detailed walkthroughs of working with microcontrollers (STM32, AVR), bootloaders (OpenBLT), and embedded C/C++
- **Career Insights**: Honest reflections on the embedded systems industry, job market, and professional growth
- **Learning Journey**: Both successes and failures in embedded development projects

## What You'll Find Here

### Recent Projects
- **OpenBLT Bootloader Implementations**: Adapting OpenBLT for different platforms (STM32H53, Bluepill Plus, Nucleo-64)
- **STM32 Development**: Working with various STM32 microcontroller families
- **AVR Projects**: Exploring 8-bit microcontroller development
- **C++ Learning**: Object-oriented programming applied to embedded systems

### Content Style
This blog follows a "learning in public" approach - you'll see the complete development process, including:
- Time estimates and actual duration of projects
- Technical obstacles and how they were overcome
- Resource recommendations and lessons learned
- Personal reflections on the engineering journey

## Technical Details

- **Built with**: Jekyll static site generator
- **Theme**: TeXt theme (customized)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions (automated)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
