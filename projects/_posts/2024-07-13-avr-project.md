The last few weeks, I had a lot of troubles with my **3D printer**, and I left my C++ course. The reasons: I don't have enough experience with the 3D printer, and I made some mistakes that affected its functionality. For example, the nozzle became useless after the filament was affected by humidity and temperature. I also had troubles with the **M4V6 Hotend** Kit and damaged the **PTFE** tube when I tried to remove it. Additionally, there was a bad calibration of the **Printer Hotbed**.

After ordering a packet of nozzles, replacing the hotbed with a glass panel, and recalibrating the machine, the printer is working again.

I was thinking of doing a project with an STM32F microcontroller. However, I had an ATMEGA328p that I hadn't used, along with wires, a breadboard, ASP programer, and a lot of new components I bought years ago. My injured pride from never developing with AVR microcontrollers in a Linux environment also weighed on my mind. This situation bothered me, so I decided to use it as therapy and create a basic manual for developing with 8-bit microcontrollers using Linux.   
Well, the results will be published on this site.

Finally, I was able to build a project and flash an **ATMEGA328p** with **avrdude**. It is a simple sequence to turn on and off the components in an RGB LED using a simple state machine implemented with a structure. I will explain it in a post. I believe that it's a good explanation to init in the way of the embedded software development using free tools

X - Files is a very good show finally I am watching the season 10 and 11 I don't believe that I lost the interest in that things!
