This is a very advanced topic for embedded systems, but due to stock market reasons and business strategy decisions at the company I worked for, I'm currently on an indefinite vacation.

Since developers tend to think in binary terms, I had two choices: either sit around regretting things and asking myself *"why me?"*, or take the opportunity to sharpen my skills while looking for a new job.

# Yocto Project

"Yocto" is the SI prefix for one of the smallest measurement scales (until 2022 when even smaller prefixes were added), meaning a multiplier of 10^-24 — that is, 0.000...1 with 24 zeros before the 1.

In our context, it means something very small. The **Yocto Project** is a set of tools used to create fully customized Linux-based operating systems, allowing you to manipulate each component in the build process.

The Yocto Project combines and maintains several key elements:

* The OpenEmbedded build system, made up of **OpenEmbedded Core** and **BitBake**.
* A Linux embedded configuration used for testing (called **Poky**).
* A broad testing infrastructure via an automated builder based on Buildbot.
* Tools for efficiently working with embedded Linux:

  * Automation tools for building and testing.
  * Processes and standards for board-level support definitions and sharing.
  * Tools for security analysis, license compliance, and SPDX-based Software Bill of Materials (SBoM) support.

There are many open source components under the Yocto Project umbrella.

**Poky**, the reference embedded OS, is a **build example** that compiles a small operating system using BitBake (the build engine), OpenEmbedded-Core, and Poky’s metadata.

The build system downloads Poky's build instructions called "recipes" and "layers". You can modify, copy, or reuse Poky’s specifications to create your own customized Embedded Linux system.

## Building a Custom Operating System

The [official documentation](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/overview-manual/yp-intro.html#introducing-the-yocto-project) explains why Yocto is an excellent choice for creating embedded system products:

* Widely adopted in the industry; many chipmakers, OS vendors, and service providers support Yocto.
* Compatible with multiple architectures (Intel, AMD, MIPS, ARM, and more).
* Supports a wide range of emulated devices through **QEMU**.
* Easy to port images and code without changing development environments.
* Highly flexible — a company can create a custom distribution and several tailored products from it.
* Great for IoT devices, allowing inclusion of only necessary components.
* Supports third-party toolchains and common architectures.
* Uses a **layered model**, letting you add packages incrementally, reducing redundancy.
* Supports partial builds, allowing you to build/rebuild individual packages.
* Offers precise dependency control, ensuring high binary reproducibility.
* Backed by an active community, helpful forums, and a strong ecosystem.
* Provides license manifests to help track open-source license usage.

## Challenges in Using Yocto

Despite its power, Yocto comes with some challenges:

* Steep learning curve; many ways to accomplish the same task.
* Understanding changes needed for a new design requires research.
* Workflow can confuse desktop/server users used to precompiled packages; here, everything must be configured and rebuilt.
* **Cross-building** environments can be unfamiliar; testing code directly on the target board may feel faster than building and transferring it.
* OpenEmbedded creates packages in standard formats (rpm, deb, ipk) — you can install these on a running system.
* Initial build times are long due to compiling everything from scratch. But Yocto caches results for future builds.

## Things I Wish I'd Known

The official docs have a ["What I Wish I'd Known"](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/what-i-wish-id-known.html#what-i-wish-i-d-known-about-yocto-project) section — here’s a summary:

Using Yocto is easy — until something breaks. Without understanding how the build process works, it can feel like a black box. Here are things to know before diving in:   
1. Use **Git** instead of tarballs to ensure updates and bug fixes.   
2. Know the **Layer Index**. All official layers are listed there, including those marked as Yocto-compatible.   
3. Use BSP layers from vendors (Intel, NXP, Raspberry Pi, etc.) as a base; don't reinvent the wheel.  
4. Avoid putting everything in one layer. Use logical separation (BSP, GUI, distro config, apps, etc.) for maintainability.  
5. Never ever modify the **Poky** layer — changes will be lost in the next release. 
6. Use the [All-in-One Mega Manual](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/singleindex.html#document-kernel-dev/4.0.16/4.3.999/index) instead of outdated Google results. 

7. Learn the build process stages:   
   1. **Fetch** – download source code.
   2. **Extract** – unpack it.
   3. **Patch** – apply fixes and features.
   4. **Configure** – set environment params.
   5. **Build** – compile and link.
   6. **Install** – place files in expected locations.
   7. **Package** – prepare files for deployment.
   Each step helps debug issues when something goes wrong.

8. You can generate dependency graphs (`-g` option) to troubleshoot build problems.
9. Understand the "magic" folder names in `tmp/work`. Use `-u` to get UI feedback in graphical or text mode.
10. You can build more than just images — individual recipes or packages too. Use the dev shell.
11. Clarify the difference: **Recipes** contain build instructions; **Packages** are the output.
12. Know what’s included in your root filesystem.
13. Learn to write custom recipes.
14. An embedded developer using Yocto should be able to:
  * Navigate corporate proxies.
  * Add packages to an image.
  * Distinguish recipes from packages.
  * Build a package and understand why.
  * Identify which files/packages belong to what.
  * Add SSH support to images.
  * Understand recipe anatomy.
  * Create and manage layers.
  * Find recipes in OpenEmbedded.
  * Know the difference between machine and distro configurations.
  * Use BSPs for your hardware.
  * Configure distro features.
  * Run and troubleshoot tasks individually.
  * Use devtools to simplify work.
  * Speed up builds using shared downloads and caches.
  * Generate and read dependency graphs.
  * Understand the BitBake environment.
  * Build SDK extensions.

15. Depending on your interests, you may want to:
  * Read the **Yocto Development Tasks Manual**.
  * Explore the **Application Development Manual** and **eSDK**.
  * Learn **Kernel Development** via its dedicated manual.
  * Learn about **Board Support Packages** (BSPs).
  * Use **Toaster**, a web interface for the Yocto build system.
  * Explore **VS Code or Eclipse** plugins.
  * Keep the **Yocto Project Reference Manual** handy.
