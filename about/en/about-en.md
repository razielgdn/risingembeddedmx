# Embedded Systems Experience

## Dextra Technologies, a Deloitte Business
*February – March 2024*, **Software Engineer II**   
Worked on two main projects: Automotive Brake Control ECU development and STM32H735 demo platform development. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to address technical challenges and meet project deadlines effectively.   

- **STM32H735G Development Kit project**:    
Implemented OpenBLT bootloader project on STM32H735G platform. The platform required a method to flash binaries from a Raspberry Pi to the STM32H5 microcontroller using CAN, I2C, and UART communication buses.    
To handle this situation, migrated the OpenBLT project from the Nucleo-H563ZI demo to the STM32H53 platform by reconfiguring GPIO, CAN, SPI, and UART interfaces and updating the corresponding STM32 HAL drivers. Git and GitHub were used to manage software version control and track changes.   

- **Brake Control ECU Project**:  
  Automotive Brake Control ECU Project: Developed software for automotive customer focusing on optimizing functionality and ensuring compliance with industry standards. 
  - Database Integration: Integrated a new database into the project to add messages and signals to the system, specifically implementing two new Diagnostic Trouble Codes (**DTCs**) and message gateways. Utilized **Tresos** to import the database and generate system resources including headers and auto-generated C files. Developed the fault control driver in **C language** following **MISRA compliance** standards, implemented failure signal transmission and gateway functionality, conducted unit testing using **SWATT**, and performed integration testing with **CANoe** and **WinIDEA**.
  - Issue Investigation: Utilized debug tools to analyze **CAN Bus** log files with CANoe to replicate issues reported by the testing department. Identified **root causes** and generated tickets with detailed analysis and proposed solutions.  
  - Implemented issue solutions according to management dashboard priorities.
  - Utilized **Jira** for project management and issue tracking.
  - Used **DOORS** for requirements management and integration test documentation.     

Utilized the following tools and technologies:  
- **Languages**: C/C++, Python, Bash.  
- **Platforms and Tools**: STM32CubeIDE, Raspbian, Git, GitHub, Jira.

Documented the analysis and defined priority levels and effort estimation.
- **Software Implementations**: Implementations were performed in the project using C language and some vector tools, common task included:
  - Updated CAN Messages and signals in the project using vector Geny to manage the databases (DBC, LDF) and the auto-generated code as headers and automatic gateways. 
  - Developed the logic and implemented code modifications to meet customer requirements following MISRA compliance standards and created unit tests using the SWATT tool. Employed CANdela to add new DTCs and DIDs with their associated services (read, write, diagnostic, etc).
- **Designed integration tests** to ensure software functionality. The tests were performed on customer-provided hardware (test benches) to simulate the vehicle system using CANoe and WinIDEA tools. Additionally, utilized CAPL to automate certain test routines.

- **Issues Resolution:** When an issue was reported by test team or the customer I participated in the analysis of the Issue reproducing the fault/erroneous behavior in the test benches to found the root causes. Using debugging tools (CANoe and WinIDEA) and  and generated reports with proposed solutions.
- **Software integration:** I was responsible for integrating software from other team members and managing releases utilizing IMS as a version control system and subsequently transitioning to Git.
